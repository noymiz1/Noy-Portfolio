                2021<br><br>Worked alongside Angela Moreno-Long to produce a speculative architectural installation using photogrammetry methods. We explored the various materialities afforded by the repeated cycling between the physical and digital, using several incarnations of the model as a means of translating between these two realms.

                <br><br>Through early iterations between physical and digital modelling the mesh became a generative tool for manipulation of trap movements. Photogrammetry scans of a mouse trap were translated in physical model with fabric to trace the movement of a trap arm snapping closed. The use of fabric in physical model was then translated back into digital form as a mesh. We used a surface drape command, mimicking physical textile qualities, to generate a mesh that was used as a crochet and weave pattern to rematerialize the mesh into physical form using the logics of the original textile.
                
                <br><br>The final iteration of this interplay between physical and digital mesh as trap used the grid pattern of pins from our physical model as the underpinning for a simulation of a mesh trap folding shut around the pins. The final digital model resulting from our interplay is conceived as a pavilion that is constantly in flux as mesh repels 
                and transforms in response to the pins.
