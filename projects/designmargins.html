                2021<br><br>Design Margins is a series of 15-min podcasts featuring dialogues centered around racial and social injustice in creative fields. Each episode invites 2 guests from design, art fields and beyond, with a highlight on BIPOC individuals. Each episode begins with a politically charged prompt for the 2 guests to expand on based on their experiences of navigating racism and other social inequities in their lives and professional practices.Â
