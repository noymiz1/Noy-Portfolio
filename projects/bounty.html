            <p class="project-blurb">
                2022<br><br>Added a new product to the Bounty paper towel line in the form of Carsheets. The product was developed in the Harvard GSD seminar, Paper or Plastic: Reinventing Shelf Life in the Supermarket Landscape. In which we were asked to operate as brand strategists. However, rather than invent new products, students will instead innovate upon existing brands.

                <br><br>We worked as a group to reconsider the entire Bounty brand including: brand architecture, brand identity, consumer target, logo, tagline, packaging, etc. We also studied our product's shelf competitors and presented our observations through visual arguments. My group and I did extensive market research, user profiling, and design iteration to reach the final product presented. 
                
                <br><br>Created in collaboration with Ruiheng Li, Sara-Ann Yong, Oliver Shi, Zhihan Wang, and Yabby Abejie. My contribution is in the form of brand identity and packaging design seen below.
